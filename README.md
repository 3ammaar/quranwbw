# About

I'm currently learning [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and what better way to do so by re-making [QuranWBW.com](https://quranwbw.com).

Checkout the live website at [svelte.quranwbw.com](https://svelte.quranwbw.com).

# Stack

[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

# API

![Hits](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.quranwbw.com%2Fv1%2Fhits&query=%24.button&label=Hits)

I am using a custom API which I've made for this new version of QuranWBW â€” [api.quranwbw.com](https://api.quranwbw.com).

The current live version of QuranWBW uses static JSON files, which is fine, until it isn't.

Having a custom API enables me to fetch verses on demand, and allows the website to have pages like [Supplications From Quran](https://svelte.quranwbw.com/supplications) or [Bookmarks](https://svelte.quranwbw.com/bookmarks).

I have not yet restricted the usage of this API on other domains/hosts, but will do that once the new website goes live.

Scrapping is strictly not allowed. If you want to use this API on your website/app for development, please contact me via [email](mailto:quranwbw@gmail.com) first.

Following are some examples, however do note that these can change or break anytime:
